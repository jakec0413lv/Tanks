## Tanks

# Introduction
This game is an in browser 2 Player Tanks game. You are given the option to choose your power, angle, and move forward or backward. You are informed of hits and misses, and a score board is implemented to keep score.

There is a reset button that resets score, and starting positions for either tank.
